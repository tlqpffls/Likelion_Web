"I see so many people on here who are technology ""experts""  stating how its slow and it sucks and its awful and its build quality is awful.With due respect its build quality is in line with paying $150 bucks for a 10.1"" tablet.  Yes its plastic, yes its screen is only 1900x1200, yes its Media Tek processor is not the top processor available today, yes it ONLY has 2GB of ram.  However your stupid if you feel like this is a letdown, after all most of this information can be found right on the page to purchase the tablet.Here is the deal with this tablet.- I bought it to watch and consume Prime video, Netflix video, (maybe someday put the google store on it for youtube (but even now i can go to youtube on the silk browser and it works perfectly fine)- I play light games, but its able to play what I play without problem.- I do not feel i need to baby this tablet because I only paid 180 bucks for it (64GB not 32) in fact i got two HD8's and this HD10 for me for less than my wife's IPAD.  So if they break it.. im not out 300 bucks-Being a network engineer this is my get away from computers without getting away.  I have zero productivity apps on it (which i like) I have zero communication apps on it (which I like), This tablet for me is a way to get away from life.  I have a phone for talking, and work, and teams, and slack.Dont kid yourself, this is not a high end tablet.  These one star reviews needs to take a better look at themselves and understand  you get what you pay for.  And for me, this absoutley works for what i need it to do.  And i dont feel like crap if i drop it and break it.why not five star.  Speakers are not great, again get what you pay for... which to me is not a big deal... i would of only taken a half a star off for them if I could.",Cody Schiemann,4.0,"October 31, 2019",United States,"18,107"
"Why was my initial review removed?I was about the update my previous 5-star good review with the following only to find my video + photo review was removed!However I discovered that there's around 10% battery drain daily, probably due to the ads on lock screen, even when airplane mode is turned on (wifi off)!I lose almost 70% to 80% charge in about a week!I am aware there's an option to pay to get rid of the ads,but the lock screen ads even consumes so much power on standby just doesn't make any sense to me.I don't mind seeing the ads. Couldn't this be optimized better?I'm now quite upset and decided to return it, for the poorly designed software that drains battery and my deleted review by amazon!",Tools. Electro.

"9/22/20 - Tablet died yesterday. Still under warranty.NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.",dd,3.0,"October 31, 2019",United States,"3,447"
"The tablet is awesome! it is really fast and it is really smooth. I have the Fire HD 8 and it's not nearly as fast or smooth at this tablet. Plus with the Anker Type C PD charger, I've been able to charge this tablet at 16 watts! Fast charging, type c, faster wifi, faster processor, and etc... this tablet is a steal at 149 dollars!",wwjoshdew,5.0,"October 30, 2019",United States,"2,812"
"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.",Tyler,1.0,"October 31, 2019",United States,"2,581"

If you're already used to the way smartphones function, this will be a piece of cake!I've been playing with it since I opened the box and have discovered the sound quality, image quality and video playback to be superior to any other tablet I've used.

"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this tablet's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.",Jcat,4.0,"October 30, 2019",United States,"1,006"
"I l logged in to increase my rating but my review was not there.  In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.

   What is this flickering on the tablet? See video and picture. Usually happens when I connect and app to Facebook. Great tablet, I love it otherwise, but not sure what’s going on with this flickeringUPDATE#1-Amazon tech support Rachel, called me after seeing my review and tried to help me. She took control of my tablet to view the problem and did trouble shooting. Amazon is going to send me a new tablet as I am the only one with this issue. I really enjoy the new fire 10! It’s faster than the 7th gen, and worth every penny! Thanks Amazon!UPDATE 2: David R from device retrieval is terrible and does not care for Amazon customers. He sent me a label to return the defective device and stated I would get a $30 credit by returning it in 48 hours which I did. But his label was missing when I tried to print so I called Amazon and was told by Lucien B. That David made a mistake and did not send me a proper label and Lucien B from amazon sent me another. I returned the device and because David’s label was not working I will not get a credit as promised. David R would not let me speak to a manager he stated he was in the highest position at Amazon and there was no one higher than him I could speak to. Plus the replacement tablet is also flickering when you connect games to Facebook!FINAL UPDATE: Rachel from tech support has taken care of all the above and sent reassuring communication to me. She has gone above and beyond to take care of my issues and keep an Amazon customer satisfied and happy. She really cares about Amazon customers! Don’t lose this employee Amazon or it would be your loss! Thanks Rachel! Regarding the tablet, the battery lasts super long, I can go 2 days without charging it!

"update 11/5/2019 9:33pm eastern3 separate support sessions, the most recent decided I needed an RMA. it arrived today and I decided to give it a shot, to continue with the support process.  loaded everything up, set it to charge and headed out for a little while.  upon my return, everything was wiped as before.  not surprised, something's up with the software on these things.  i did try the delete app cache/etc for kindle app itself on the fire, but that did not work either.  i havent heard back from the escalated person I was working with in a few days, but they definitely have some reading material from me when they are able to get to it.  stay tuned!original review text:after multiple support requests, amazon wants to ""replace under warranty."" there's nothing physically wrong with this device, it will just delete all of your downloaded content while charging.  its pretty much garbage software, the hardware is great though.  really frustrating.",Robert,1.0,"November 3, 2019",United States,271
"Wow, with the sub-par reviews from the tablet snobs and geeks. This was 150 bucks! I bought three Fire HD8 tablets two years ago for me, my wife and daughter. Used almost daily and still like new. Replaced a Samsung 8 tablet that I was never really happy with. Love this upgrade. What a great size for watching videos, and the sound is pretty decent. A cheap pair of plug-in or bluetooth speakers will make it even better. Even better with headphones. Had a couple of friends with Apple tablets get these after they saw mine. I can shove mine in a backpack and tote it around carefree while they have to worry about damaging an expensive piece of gear. Now they are enjoying the Fire and don't miss the IPad. I can't speak for anyone doing anything other than watching videos, playing light games and surfing the internet. Oh, and reading! I love reading books and comics on this thing - even better with the bigger screen! Anyways, I digress, if you're into the things I mentioned then don't hesitate to buy this. At this price-point it is an awesome entertainment gadget, and I would never try to do spreadsheets or Power Point presentations for a million dollar deal (although it might do that?). Someone else mentioned that it doesn't do well with a Malware program. This is my third tablet and I have never had a problem with malware. Not sure why, but just throwing that out there. Never used anti-malware. I love these tablets and am really excited after putting this one through the paces!I have to add - buying the Amazon case for this is a must! Honest to God, I don't work for Amazon, but the cases that go with these are the absolute best and look and feel like they were built together. I admit the case is a little pricey but worth every penny. I bought an aftermarket case for the aforementioned Samsung tablet and hated it. It just felt ""wonky"", like a cheap glove.",bhinch,5.0,"October 31, 2019",United States,201

"Fantastic product! My kids have a few fire 7's to beat around with, but wanted something a bit faster mainly for streaming and browsing.Extremely quick between apps, videos play without any issue, screen looks beautiful compared to past iterations.  Most bad reviews so far have been people trying to use incompatible accessories from past fire hd tablets that used micro USB.Fast charging time with 15w adapters and the type C port is a welcome upgrade.  Obviously if your not a fan of the amazon ecosystem or OS, then you might want to go with something that runs stock Android or iOS.  For the price and these specs, this tablet really can't be beat.",Bryan,5.0,"October 31, 2019",United States,202
"Very disappointed. First - The Silk browser which apparently is the only one I can use accepts, without question nor warning, revoked SSL/TLS certificates. Anyone who uses it is setting themselves up for some potential serious malware attacks. Second - My old Kindle Fire HD 8.9 had a mini HDMI port that allowed me to connect the device to a big screen TV which I used off grid to watch Prime content by downloading Prime shows/movies to the device then bring it with me when I went off grid. The ""All New FireHD 10 Tablet"" has no such port and hence no such capability. It doesn't support Screen Mirroring either so recasting to a larger device is a desirable feature that was deprecated. Had I known that Amazon was taking these desirable capabilities off the table I would never have purchased this new device to replace my current one.I will say that it is much faster than my old Kindle Fire and that the screen is much nicer but the eliminated features render it virtually useless to me!I tried to add an image of the GRC Certificate Revocation output by using the Silk Browser to access Revoked dot GRC dot Com and using the screen capture on the kindle device to capture the revocation notice. I was able to do that successfully and capture the screen but when I attached the Kindle to my computer to the grab the image and attach it to this review I was informed that my Kindle had ZERO directories or files on it. Another serious problem with this device discovered while trying to document 2 other game changing problems.Now, the best for last. The Kindle Fire HD 10 9th Generation cannot and will not connect to my Fire TV Recast.  The Recast is wired Ethernet connected to a gigabit router with cat6 UTP throughout the house (including connections to my many other Fire Sticks.) Everything communicates just fine except the HD10 - and that includes my Samsung Galaxy S8+. This new tablet insists I need to plug an Ethernet cable into the recast in order to make the connection. That connection is already in place and every other device on the network knows it - except for the New and Improved Kindle Fire HD10 9th generation!  Going into settings in any of my fire TV devices to Live TV/Recast shows a wired connection  with an internal IP address (192.168.1.xxx), and a wired and a wireless MAC address for the Recast Device.I tried everything under the sun to get this to work but to no avail. It just wasn't going to happen. I removed the FireTV app from the HD10,  shut everything down, removed the Ethernet cable from the Recast, started the devices up again, downloaded and installed the Recast APP on the Kindle, started the pairing process, got to the screen where it says ""Your Fire TV Recast needs an Ethernet Cable plugged into it...."".  So I plugged it back in and nothing happened. I was given no option to move ahead. All I could do was back up a screen and go into an endless loop of going nowhere!In desparation I did a factory reset on the HD10 and went through the pain of setting it up and re-authenticating with my highly entropic 63 character bullet proof passwords only to end up back in the same place... NOWHERE!Can you spell ""BUYER'S REMORSE"" and ""UTTER FRUSTRATION""?

"Amazon is really going down. I've had lots of battery trouble with all my kindkes. It's the battery that kills them. And while I was able to replace the battery on my first kindle, they made it harder, then impossible. But I got this new kindle so I would be able to restore my bookmarks. The main reason I hate the Silk browser is not being able to import or export bookmarks. I think it's deliberate. But I bought this new 10 inch just to keep my bookmarks. But while it would restore my ebooks, it wouldn't restore my bookmarks, which is a deal breaker for me.Got on the phone trying to get help and talked to someone who barely spoke Engish, who wanted to wipe my old 8.9, the kindle I loved best, instead of this 10 inch. And when I said bookmarks this guy thought I meant ebooks, which did restore. Took a while to half show him what I was talking about. No matter how long I was on, following his directions, no bookmarks.Now I have to send this back, get another kind of tablet and lose all my bookmarks. Really upset about it.

Purchased new Kindle Fire because update on phone no longer allowed me to connect to my hotspot and figured that it was time to update since I had my kindle fire for a few years. I liked the text to speech feature on my table which allows me to listen to my books while I am working. On the new kindle the text to speech reads a page when the cover is closed and then stops. When the cover is open the text to speech may last at the max 20minutes before it stops. Sometimes it will start again once the screen is unlocked. If you value this feature this is extremely annoying. And there is nothing listed on the help manual to fix this problem.  I have not tried the other features on the tablet yet only had it for a couple of days but the main feature that I wanted which is text to speech is the feature I am having the most issues with. I called tech support and was offered $5 for my inconvenience and told that the problem is a known issue and will be fixed in two days.

"I will keep it short and simple. Picture and sound are great. does seem faster at times but at others times will be ""laggy"" for no reason when I am not downloading or streaming things. Last the big issue I have is that it keeps.deleting my ebooks, I have had a kindle some the first gen kindle fire and have a nice ebook collection and  it matter how I try it seems to delete and.I download every 8 to 10 hours and so far no real answers from tech support.UPDATE: Okay so a day after this review was posted I was contacted by an Amazon tech person. This time after explaining what was going on and what had already been tried I was sent a new kindle along with instructions on how to return the one I had. The new one came and the old one picked up 3 days later. I downloaded a book and it was still there for 2 days but on the third day it had been deleted, however the kindle had also received an update. Later the same day the same tech person called me and asked about things to which I explained okay till that morning when again books where deleted from the unit. I was told that the update was to fix this issue. (Guess I was not the only one) I am very happy to say that since thank have downloaded my library of over 600 books and no issues with them be deleted now after a week.

"I'm not the typical user of a tablet; not a gamer, do all my computing at home on a desktop, don't do social media, don't even have a smartphone.  I've worn out one Kindle E-reader and am hard at work on the second.  I would quite probably have let the tablet scene pass me by, except that I acquired (in 2013) one of the early Fire tablets (HD7) as a premium gift for buying a treadmill from Yowza Fitness.  In a word, I loved it; book and magazine illustrations in Hi-def color was one of its most enjoyable features to me at the time.  It was a little underpowered for video, though it would stream non-HD content fair-to-middling and play just about any downloaded video just fine, HD or not.  So I used and enjoyed it for six years, until I caught wind of the soon-to-be-released Amazon Fire Tablet HD10; there was a lot being said about it, most of it quite positive, enough so that I took the plunge and invested a little less than 250 dollars (tablet, case and heavily-discounted SD memory card).  I can't speak for others, only for myself, but I think I got a heck of a good deal.  The tablet is beautifully made and has a good solid heft; the case is a perfect match for it.  The designers and manufacturer couldn't have improved on it; for looks, I think they came up with a winner.  The colors, graphics, video definition (it also streams HD just fine!) are all top of the line.  It's a bit more complicated than the other one, but still easily learned.  It comes with a fairly large number of Apps preinstalled, and that aren't designed to be removed; I don't mind that too much since there's only a very few that I wouldn't use at all, and I've got LOTS of storage space.  But it is kind of annoying that I can't ""hide"" the icons that fill up the Home screen like I can do on my old desk-top Acer running Win 10.  And while I have nothing against it, I also have no real use for or interest in the Alexa feature; its home-screen icon is four times the size of all the others, and constantly exhorts me to tell Alexa to do something.  But those are minor details and take nothing at all away from my overall positive view of this exceptionally fine example of precision electronics.  And the price! A genuine bargain.  Thanks very much for a fine product and letting me say a few words about it.UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW January 26, 2021:  I've had this tablet for just over 14 months, and have used & enjoyed it just about every day of those 14 months.  I successfully installed Google Play Store shortly after I bought the tablet, specifically to get Google Chrome which greatly enhanced its value & utility.  I was able to watch HD videos on YouTube, TV shows & movies on Amazon Prime, all without any buffering.  I regularly read books & magazines in stunning color on the nice large 10-inch screen using the Libby App.  In short, I was very happy indeed with my tablet.  Which is why I was both surprised and disappointed when it suddenly and inexplicably stopped working.  I'd been reading a library book off and on the past few days (I've read dozens on the tablet) and today I stopped reading to have supper; just closed the case like I've done from the beginning as it just puts the tablet to sleep.  When I'm ready to use it again I just open the case and the advert screen comes on first; I just swipe upwards and get back to the exact page of my book that I was reading, or the home screen if I closed the app before putting the tablet to sleep.  After supper today, when I opened the case, I was met with a blank screen, like I'd completely powered down (I hadn't).  Pressing the on/off switch did nothing; pressing and holding for a slow count of 10 was the same.  Plugging it in to the AC Charger should have within a few seconds rebooted the tablet; several times I've read or watched videos to the point where I ran out of juice and the tablet says ""powering down"" and turns itself off, but plugging it into the AC turns it right back on again, showing the charging symbol doing it job.  The tablet was not low on battery power this time; when I closed the case to go eat supper the battery icon in the upper right corner read 48%; it should not have turned completely off, it should have just gone to sleep like it always has.  Even after leaving it on the AC Charger for >2 hours, pressing the on/off switch did nothing; the tablet is completely dead, and I cannot figure out why; it was working flawlessly.  What I said in my original view about its being an ""exceptionally fine example of precision electronics"" still holds.  This is a great tablet; I just had bad luck with mine.",xgi93,5.0,"November 4, 2019",United States,95
"I thought this was going to be a great tablet until I got it and realized it had two capabilities missing. It has no screen mirror capability even to their own Fire TV stick! There are standards here, it should work with Roku and Chromecast and other TV streaming devices. Then I moved to ""well I will have to go to the wired mode"". But no, the new USB-C connector is used for charging and DOES NOT SUPPORT USB-C TO HDMI TO GET TO YOUR TV. With these 2 capabilities missing the tablet is so crippled it will have to sell for a much lower price.Given this I encourage Amazon to bring back screen mirroring and to bring industry standard capability to the ""USB-C"" connector or label it a charging port and not USB-C. Without these changes I give the tablet a 1 star rating.",Kent H.,1.0,"November 26, 2019",United States,106
"I own previous generation of Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10.  So, I know how the Fire tablet works with micro sd card.However, this is Fire HD 10 tablet, working with micro sd card is a challenge.  After spending some time and some tests, I have some findings.  This Fire HD 10 tablet requires you to erase (format) your inserted micro sd card before the first use in the tablet.  And the format is only FAT32.  (FAT32 is a problem for some large size Sandisk micro sd card with the File  Reading Error.  I was told that ExFat format is safe for large size micro sd card)Regardless, you can't come prepare with files on your inserted micro sd card.  You have to let this Fire tablet to erase (format) for you.  Once you do that, it gives you two options.  1.  Use the micro sd card as the internal storage of the fire tablet, i.e. apps  2.  Use the micro sd card as portable storage only, i.e. music files or data files)So, you don't have to flexibility to switch sd cards.I tested a 32G, 64G and 128G micro sd card.

"I just received my fire hd10 today. I have had it for about 8 hours. So far, I hate it. I have  fire tablet 8 and I think I might send this thing back for a refund!! I love my 8, which is why I ordered the 10. It was supposed to be better. It's NOT! I tried calling every support number for this thing I could find. On one I got an answering machine that said it was the help line for the fire 10, then it said goodbye and hung up. I have been shopping at Amazon since they first started in business and have continued to transfer as much of my business to Amazon as I can throughout the years.  This fire he 10 has me rethinking that practice. There is no help with the fire hd 10! At this point, I would NOT recommend anyone purchasing a fire he 10! In fact I would tell them to stay away from them and to with the older models.  There's not instruction manual with this machine, but I just found one on Amazon (using my 8 tablet) that so can buy for an additional $14.95.

"I have read a few reviews in the tech press that lack any detail, leading me to feel the writer has spent little time with this device. I have been using it for just under a month and wish to share my experience. The screen image quality is very good. I have watched several videos on Netflix and Amazon among others and have found the image quality to be excellent.The audio and the projected stereo sound field is at times extraordinary. I, have on more than one occasion looked to the side as a result of the stereo sound field.  One must recognize the speakers are extremely small and keep one's expectations realistic!Battery life is, in my experience awesome. I can watch 2 full-length movies, no problem with juice left to spare. last night, I spent 4 hours with it and it still showed 54% battery remaining. I call that excellent.The device itself is somewhat heavy and very, very slippery so I urge you to purchase a case quickly.Now I come to the Amazon Fire 10HD operating system, a fork of Android.  It handles somewhat different than pure Android but those who have used Android will quickly find the way. The included applications, such as calendar, Silk search, and email are plain and simple but get the job done with a very small learning curve. I suspect Amazon is concerned that some will purchase this fine device with little or no experience with software so keep it simple rules the day.Even, after all this time the Alexa app still suffers a poor user interface. Navigating its convoluted route through Alexa reality is at times confusing at best and I use 3 Chromebooks and 2 PC's so I can most often ""hack it"" around the worst. Most who purchase the device with experience with the Alexa app will suffer only minor pain.Now I fear I have come to the Amazon App Store. The depth and breadth is very small compared to Google's Play Store. Perhaps one fine day Amazon and Google will work something out and Fire tablet sales will explode.A major positive is that  Amazon provides the means of turning off all the Amazon promo stuff so one will not be tortured with pushed adds. Of course, some will like the adds!I must say, without a doubt, at the sale price this tablet is a steal!  If one is an Amazon video user,  along with Netflix buying the Fire HD 10 is an easy and intelligent choiceI wish to add that I have been an Amazon customer for some 11 years and have been satisfied with other Amazon products and Amazon Customer Service is outstanding, period!",Mic,5.0,"November 23, 2019",United States,73
"I had bought a fire tablet a year or so ago. Due to the poor performance and lack of apps I returned it. Fast forward to now I tried again. I will say the tablet performed well for the price. The problem i had, with my less than a week old tablet, was with the touch screen. There was a spot on the screen that was acting like I was pressing it but nothing was touching the screen. I tried cleaning, removing from case, and every other thing I found online. Nothing worked so I contacted Amazon. After 40 min on chat they are going to send a replacement. 3 days later (when I purchased the original it showed up the next day) I get the replacement only to see that it's a remanufactured tablet. Sorry but that's not acceptable to me. I paid for a new tablet and received one that didnt work so I get sent a remanufactured one instead? No thanks!

You can't beat this type of a bargain for a functional full-size tablet. It has plenty of stock apps in the Amazon store...

"For me, this was a huge step up. I have been using a 2nd Generation Kindle Fire but wanted to be able to use some of the options on the new Fire Tablet.Jumping from 12.6 GB to 64 GB (with an option up to 512 GB) was an important need, giving me the ability to store/use the amount of video I anticipate to be sharing in the coming months. I also had a need for a camera, and the Fire HD 10 has two, front and rear. Additionally, I was excited to see the difference between the speed of my current unit versus the new one. The unit also touted faster charging than before, which would be nice as my 2nd Gen charges at a glacial pace.As far as extras, the 64 GB is a healthy chunk more than the 32 GB, so you can save some dollars if you don’t need the storage. I wanted even more storage, so I added a San-Disk 128 micro SD Memory Card. As stated above, you can have add more memory, but this seemed to be enough for my current needs. If you drop things from time to time or have exploratory children, adding the case is good insurance.Easy to set up, and so far, it’s been everything promised.

"Arrived yesterday and setup went fine except that the new tablet couldn't restore from my Amazon backup. It's not a huge deal because I use a handful of non-default apps: Netflix, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram & Twitter. Running lean on the prior gen Fire helped to keep things from getting bogged down...I'm happy to say that the new CPU and RAM keeps things very responsive. CCleaner doesn's seem to work reliably but now you can close all open apps at once in the task manager...huge plus. I am happy with it....I ordered a new cover but found my old cover fit. Unfortunately the Alexa Dock doesn't work....it uses micro USB and the new tab is USB C. Ah well, progress...Update: Tablet will lock up on formatting micro sd card as internal storage. Will format as portable storage just fine. Not sure what the issue is. I’m removing a star every time i spend more than 5 minutes trying to do something.Update: Tablet will not connect to bluetooth keyboard. It does not see the keyboard during the pairing process.

"This is my 23 fire tablet and so far I hate it.  The home screen text is smaller at the largest size.  Text everywhere is outlined making it very hard to read.  The line showing video, books, apps, etc. at the top of the home screen is all in a white outlined text and an icon for the apps library overwrites it and can't be turned off.  Many of the screens have overlapping text, as if trying to squeeze too much in.  And after searching for the past hour it seems I can't change or customize any of this.  I don't care how much better the battery life is if I hate looking at the thing.  Wish I had my old HDX back, as far as I'm concerned the Fire tablets are getting cheaper and worse.  Going to buy a galaxy, name brand loyalty only goes so far.  And what happened to the Echo Spot?!?

Also, icon size and fonts are not changeable/customizable in a native fashion. Was able to sideload a normal android app to kinda work, but not 100% successful. In the end, had to return it. Screen is nice and clear, and responsiveness is good, but lack of cast, fonts, and later i discovered USB-C to HDMI made it unsuitable for my needs.

Second, when I turned it on, I expected to see the standard android screen, not a setup where I was required to hook up my wifi before I could do anything else.  But fine, once I did that, I discovered there is no browser, and even trying to go to the playstore requires logging into my amazon account.I could see that if I were buying a simple kindle book reader, but I thought I was buying a tablet.  The UI on the device is basically rewritten to be push amazon sales.

"With so many reviews I doubt anyone needs another one to make a decision on whether or not to purchase this newer Fire 10 tablet, but I'm very satisfy with the purchase and I feel it's fair to share that experience. I own a Fire 10 2017 tablet and other than for the occasional book reading and video watching, I preferred to use my old laptop Instead because the table's slow response, especially at the startup. I hated it going to the internet as well because the pages were slow to open and to response. I have fiber optic internet, so internet speed wasn't the issue.But this newer Fire 10 tablet is so much faster and responsive to every command. Whether is online shopping, watching the news, searching the internet or watching a movie, you can see and feel the difference...like day and night. I ordered the black color tablet and the one issue that may be bothersome, especially for those with bad eyesight, is that the power and volume buttons are not easy to find. Since the screen can rotate, you may find yourself pressing on the wrong side of the tablet, especially at night when your partner is sleeping and then suddenly a video pop-up on your screen and the table's volume happens to be way up. I'm sure you'll get use to it, but really would have like the buttons to be of different color like red, blue or green.I recommend that it you do get one, order the cover as well. It's made specifically for the tablet, it's also of high quality, looks great and can protect your investment. Whether to order the 32 or 64 GB that's your preference; I ordered the 64 GB because I feel is better to have a larger storage and don't need it, than to need it and not having it. I loaded the Google Play store because of the apps I constantly use, so I'm sure the larger storage will come on handy. I also purchased a 128 GB  SD card for videos, photos and file storage.To summorize, this tablet is faster than its predecessor, still at an amazing low price and I'm sure if you get one you'll like as well. I recommend it.",Felix,5.0,"November 21, 2019",United States,42
"Prior to this, I had a Kindle Fire HD 8 (7th Generation). I traded it in once the new HD 10 was available for preorder (receiving 20% off). I am very satisfied with my purchase; however, there are a few things I need to note here.Hardware: The CPU is a MediaTek 8183. It's four Cortex-A73 and four Cortex-A53 cores running at 2.0 GHz. Performance is very solid, so much better than the previous models which were running quad-core only. The 2GB of RAM is a bit of a hurdle (it really should have been 3 GB), but the 32GB of storage with expandable card slot are great for the price. The 10"" 1080p touchscreen is good looking, but it also feels of a better quality and sensitivity than the previous models. The battery is 6300 mAh, and I find myself charging it once every 2-3 days. The USB-C port is the best upgrade Amazon made here.Software: The system is Fire OS 7. When you install apps to view system information, they claim it's a modified version of Android 9.0 Pie. Some of Pie's features are readily noticeable (clock screen on the left, a supported Picture in Picture mode, etc.) but you can also tell it's a very slimmed down experience. For example, there is no apparent multi-window support (though developer options show the option is somewhere deep in the system). The settings are also very, very slimmed down - which can make it hard to configure the tablet the way you might a stock Android tablet.App Support: It is still possible to sideload Android apps to the tablet (including Google Play), but you do so at your own risk. As with previous versions of Fire OS, not every Android app will be compatible. What concerns me, however, is that some of Amazon's own apps have performance issues despite being preloaded into Fire OS. Amazon Music, for instance, would not work the first time my tablet was set up. I had to factory reset just to make it work. Amazon's apps are also more frequently updated in the Google Play store than in Amazon's own appstore. I don't understand why they do things this way.I plan to keep this tablet for at least two years. I hope to get a lot of versatility from it. Hopefully you will as well.",M.

"if you are looking for ""out of the box friendly,"" boy are you in the wrong place.  This is my 4th Kindle tablet and including my first one when I was a complete novice, this is absolutely the worst as far as internet use is concerned. Oh, yes, I have connection BUT I CANNOT GET TO A SEARCH ENGINE PAGE.  I get these clogged up pages with buttons to push, NO search box at all, and syncing bookmarks from previous device is a complete (not funny) joke!  I hate this.  My old tablet did need to be replaced but I should have bought local so i could easily seek help.  Amazon help is sporadic and can be useless.  I figure I will eventually stumble on satisfactory usage but it hasn't happened in five days yet.  I admit, I am not technical, but I wasn't with my first three, and I did not have this much trouble.  Do not get this unless you are very comfortable with technical angles of set up.  I have been blindsided by how unfriendly this is!Update and this is not good:  some 6 or 7 months later.  You are aware we have had some major distractions during the months, so I have made sporadic attempts to synch my tablet to my printer.  Now, I can read the manual so I tried that route.  I have a pretty well known make of printer:  HP but when I clicked on the link to download the HP app, I got a ""sorry, that page no longer exists"" message.  I even returned several times to try, I suppose thinking it would suddenly exist again.  Anyway, yesterday, I decided to dedicate the time to call tech service at AZ.  The young woman who took my call was marginally knowledgeable and did seem to have some resources available, but OVER AN HOUR LATER, I was out of time (and patience) and she seemed out of ideas.  We parted amicably but the conclusion we reached is that there is no HP printer app available for Kindle 10.  I am still unable to use my wireless printer with this Kindle. And oh by the way, I frequently printed from my previous Kindle.  The block against HP was certainly hushed up in the promos for this tablet.  Grrrr.",CenTexGal,2.0,"November 2, 2019",United States,44
"I am greatly disappointed with this tablet. Not because of performance but lack of control over configuration and available apps from the Appstore. Also preloaded with a lot of junk apps that I cannot remove. Unable to install more secure, privacy enabled browser. Built in Silk Browser isn't even configurable for increased privacy. This is only good for use as an ebook reader and video player for Netflix, Prime and Hulu. It's a shame because display and performance are cancelled out by Amazon centric operating system and preloaded junk. Will be returning and looking for a more consumer friendly tablet.",alex s,1.0,"November 25, 2019",United States,49
"If you intend to add an SD card, to store large files (videos, movies, etc), then you are out of luck with the latest Fire tablets!Disclaimer: I installed the Google play store. I have some apps that run in the background.This tablet ocasionally loses its WiFi connection.My installed apps occasionally lose permission to the sdcard.The tablet updates and resets, without prompting.I think the OS is biased against standard Play Store apps.This tablet is not acceptable for keeping appointments, and scheduling tasks, etc.Probably useful for Amazon apps video, music, but, the Kindle Fire OS is a poor implementation of standard Android capabilities.",Ron Kropp,1.0,"November 28, 2019",United States,38
"Mostly I'm disappointed. I know read the reviews. If you are buying it to watch movies and tv shows you will probably love it. It just arrived today. As I am checking it out it has jumped between non related things a couple times. Also unfortunately I will have to reinstall several things that I hoped would make the transfer. It seems as though Google is there almost every time I bring up anything that needs a password or try to open e-mail. I have difficulty seeing and have used kindles for years because I can adjust the print. On the HD 10 one of the first things I did was adjust the print size. Very disappointed. All of my kindles have the pop-up's left in, they never bothered me that much. Usually if you are not interested or occasionally offended by something you tap not interested, something else pops-up, you still have the option to tap not interested, but it doesn't necessarily change. Also you can no longer leave many of the pop-up until the clock runs out on it. No these are real commercials, you have to wait till the end before going back to your whatever. I loved both of my HDX's and my Voyager, my paper white, etc. More recently it seems kindles have become more of a kids toy. I asked what was the very best Kindle they had on the market today. I did not mention price or anything else, just what was the best. This was it. I have bought more than 20 kindles. This will probably be the last. By the way my HDX still works.Up date-I'm adding a star. I spoke with a pleasant representative, easy to understand,  knew the product. Finally someone acknowledged they didn't have an answer for why the print was so tiny, even though I had gone into settings increasing the size to the max. They transferred me to a Kindle rep. Immediately showed me what to do. Simple, straight forward, increases the font size for books. Wow! Three things, solved a major problem since I use Kindles for reading because my sight is impaired, knew the product and was easy to understand.",Rowan,4.0,"November 15, 2019",United States,37
"Its much faster than my old HD 10 (7th generation).  I had one problem getting going.  I had purchased a 128 GB SD card from Amazon to go with the tablet.  The setup only took a few minutes then I put the SD card into the tablet. I've done this many times before.  You place the SD card in the slot than go into the ""Storage"" section of settings and touch the ""mount SD Card""  icon.  usually once you pressed this icon it would change to ""remove the SD Card"".  When I touched it the icon flashed then went back to its original ""Mount SD Card.  A couple of minutes later the screen when white with the notice ""reformatting the SD Card"".  The scale stayed at 20% for about 10 minutes when the screen went blank.  I pushed the on/off button and nothing.  After about 10 minutes I tried holding the button in to restart the tablet.  Nothing happened.  I called Amazon help during which another 20 minutes passed.  Once I explained my problem to the tech the screen lit up on the tablet and everything was normal and the SD Card was installed. Something happened but the tech couldn't explain it. The tablet ended up down for about an hour.  Also I just noticed there is no menu under the external storage  option.  My 7th generation gave me choices as what to save - there is nothing at all in the menu on the new HD 10,",Herb,4.0,"October 30, 2019",United States,34
"I bought this when my fire stopped connecting to wi-fi, I thought this would behave a lot like my fire which I really liked.  It is not one finger tap, using from one to 4 fingers and I don't know why they changed that.  it is not intuitive like the original fire and it does not want to work with the games I like, not responding to commands with a simple tap and drag like the fire did.  it should not be this difficult to use.",Kurt B. Benson,2.0,"November 1, 2019",United States,34
"I purchased this because I needed an inexpensive device to read around the house.  It had to be light enough to hold without fatigue, have good battery life, and be able to run a selection of my Android apps. For the most part, it met my expectations.Price was very good. At $100, this was far less expensive than an iPad (which my daughter absonded with), the Pixel Slate (which though I still own, has lots of software issues), and other devices from Samsung (yup, good devices but out of my price range).Weight is not bad. It's not as light as the iPad but acceptable for my needs. Battery life seems very good. It took a while to charge, but I've been using it for a few hours and it's still above 80% charge.Main downside is that the Amazon version of Android doesn't have the Google Play app store. Amazon has a subset of apps including Netflix, various office tools, some games, HBO Go, etc.. These suffice for the most part, but installing Chrome browser requires downloading APKs and enabling supposedly insecure sources. Final nitpick is that the home screen seems like a big adspace for Amazon. I like Amazon but don't want it in my face all the time.",Kwan L. Lowe,4.0,"November 24, 2019",United States,32
"I had the previous version but it got stepped on. I got this one because of that. I was so sad when my other one broke but, in retrospect, it was okay because I LOVE the new one!The interface is sleeker. Even the icons are streamlined, giving it a higher end feel for the same great price.The graphics got an upgrade and you can tell. It's faster and the battery life is still impressive.I did have the opportunity to use tech support because the transfer process didn't work. In theory, you can use Amazon cloud to transfer everything on your old tablet to your new tablet. It didn't work, tech support was bluntly unable to help but it was literally the best bad results support phone call I've ever had. The rep was genuine, funny and you could tell that this was tech support, not customer service because he told me immediately that this was a known problem and wouldn't be solved. He thanked me for accepting reality LOL and moving on without yelling at him.The best thing about these tablets is the affordability. It puts all the Amazon branded entertainment in your hands at a reasonable price. The worse thing is the unavailability of some of the most widely used apps (like realtor apps, art apps and design app). The durability and affordability makes these tablets natural workhorses but the lack of access to basic apps hinders people from using them. That's a huge problem and that's where this review went from five stars to four.",TXEggplant,4.0,"November 21, 2019",United States,28
"Books don't stay saved on the device or the SD card. I download them, and within 24 hours they are gone. Amazon tech support acknowledged that this is an issue with the latest version (9th generation) of the HD10. I suspect they'll have a solution in place soon, but until then the device is worthless to me. [Amazon is great about returns, so they sent me a prepaid mailing label so that I can return my new HD10.] I've been really satisfied with other/previous versions of the Fire (HD8, HDX, HD10), so this is a major disappointment.",Kindle Customer,2.0,"November 8, 2019",United States,35
"The tablet seems fine, but be aware, you are paying for an ad machine. There are ads on the lockscreen and throughout the device.My kids can't go 5 minutes without asking about the latest ad they saw on my lockscreen.It apparently costs an extra $15 to remove. That is Amazon holding your eyeballs hostage.I refuse to negotiate with such tactics and will be returning. I'd rather spend an extra $500 and get something tried and true.",Arik,2.0,"November 23, 2019",United States,35
